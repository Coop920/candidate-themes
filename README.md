Theming Challenge
================
Fork this repo and clone it into your local development site.

Using the design comp located at bling/comp/standard-donate.png, update the bling theme to style the default donation form accordingly. Use the template file page--donation_form.tpl.php and donation-layout.css to accomplish this. Additionally, the form should be responsive and react to changes in device screen size. There will be no comps provided for non-desktop device view. Use your creativity to come up with a suitable display for these devices. You may use whatever tools neccessary to produce the responsive version.

This task will be evaluated on the following merits:

* Visual adherence to the provided comp
* Cross-browser uniformity (IE7-IE10, Firefox, Chrome, Safari)
* CSS organization and usage
* HTML
* Creativity of responsive solution
